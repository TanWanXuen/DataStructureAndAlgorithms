# DataStructureAndAlgorithms
This assignment analyzes the performance of comparison-based (Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Tim Sort) and non-comparison-based (Counting Sort) algorithms across 11 experimental scenarios, including random, sorted, reversed, and duplicate-heavy datasets. Using time complexity as the main metric, we evaluated efficiency and compiled comparative results to highlight each algorithmâ€™s strengths and limitations. The findings offer practical guidance on choosing suitable sorting techniques for diverse data challenges.
