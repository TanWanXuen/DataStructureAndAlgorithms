# DataStructureAndAlgorithms
In this assignment, we explore the performance and efficiency of various sorting algorithms, with focus on both comparison-based (Merge-Sort, Selection-Sort, Tim-Sort) and non-comparison based (Counting-Sort) algorithms. Our objective was to comprehensively analyse these algorithms by applying them to datasets of varying sizes and characteristics.
